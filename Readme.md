# A tutorial on Next.js (TraversyMedia)

## Summary

Nothing profound here - I wanted to learn how to do React SSR, so here I am.

## Goals

- Learn Next.js development flow from initialization to deployment

## Todos

1. Initialization and Setup

   Start by initializing npm (done)
   Make a gitignore file, so we don't upload our modules (or sensitive material in the future) (done)
   Install Next.js, React, and React-DOM (done)
   Assign Next as run scripts for dev, build, and start in package.json (done)
   Make a folder called 'pages'. This is, funny enough, where all our pages of our website will go. This is how Next.js does routing. (done)
   Make a file inside the pages direcory called index.js, which not suprising. By default, files named 'index' are run when directories are 'evoked' (right term?) (done)
